msgid "The plugin offers a way to maintain dynamic multilingual content on a WordPress site. While static localization is already excellently implemented and offered by WordPress framework through <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/\">po/mo file framework</a>, it is still impossible to maintain dynamic multilingual content without an additional specialized plugin, a kind of which qTranslate-X belongs to. For example, what if you need to make title, content and excerpt of a page to be multilingual? In theory, it could be handled by po/mo files, but in an insanely inconvenient way."

msgid "To deal with dynamic content, qTranslate-X provides language switching buttons on applicable admin editing pages, which, once pressed, make all the text of multilingual fields to be filled with the language chosen.

Thus, a concept of <a href=\"https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/multilingual-fields/\" title=\"Concept of 'Multilingual Field'\">multilingual field</a> is in use here, as opposite to a concept of whole separate page or separate site for each language, as it is done in a number of other multilingual content management plugins, see, for example, free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\" title=\"Plugin 'Polylang'\">Polylang</a> or paid <a href=\"https://wpml.org/\" title=\"The WordPress Multilingual Plugin\">WPML</a>.

msgid "You may still find some useful information through reading <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/\" title=\"Original qTranslate plugin\">qTranslate</a>'s original documentation, which is not duplicated here in full. There are also other plugins, which offer multilingual support, but it seems that Qian Qin has a very good original back-end design, and many people have been pleasantly using his plugin ever since. It stores all translations in the same single post, which makes it easy to maintain and to use it with other plugins. However, the user interface of former qTranslate got out of sync with the recent versions of Wordpress, especially after WP went to TinyMCE 4. There is a number of forks of qTranslate, see for example, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mqtranslate/\" title=\"mqTranslate plugin\">mqTranslate</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-xp/\" title=\"qTranslate Plus plugin\">qTranslate Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/\" title=\"zTranslate plugin\">zTranslate</a>. They all try to fix qTranslate's user interface preserving its original back-end, which is what this plugin does too. This plugin is a hybrid of all of them and fixes a few bugs in each of them. It also has many new features too, like theme custom translatable fields, for example. We hope that this plugin is the most complete working version which combines the best features of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/\" title=\"Original qTranslate plugin\">qTranslate</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mqtranslate/\" title=\"mqTranslate fork\">mqTranslate</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-xp/\" title=\"qTranslate Plus fork\">qTranslate Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/\" title=\"zTranslate fork\">zTranslate</a>."

Most sites are expected to be unaffected, since the first language in the order is normally the default langauge.
